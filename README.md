# how-late-is-noah

ok so basically this app calculates how late noah is assuming we have the same walk from class. when we cross paths i can press a button and it will tell me exactly how late noah is using M A T H

you know those problems they make you do in middle school where it's like there's a train and you have to figure out where they'll meet? well it's like that. but for noah.
